# Servo-Motor-Braking-System
This project demonstrates an automatic braking system using an Arduino, a servo motor, an IR sensor, and a relay. The system is designed to detect obstacles and stop a motorized system while applying a braking mechanism via a servo motor. This is useful in applications such as safety mechanisms for moving vehicles or automated conveyor systems.
